# Community Garden Planting

![Community Event](/images/community_event.png)

To celebrate Earth Day, we launched our new Community Garden project. Neighbors joined hands to plant vegetables, herbs, and flowers that will provide fresh produce to the community center kitchen.

It was a beautiful day of sunshine, soil, and smiles.

### What We Planted
- Tomatoes
- Peppers
- Zucchini
- Basil & Cilantro
- Sunflowers

We can't wait to see the garden grow!
