# Community Bike Repair Event

We believe that reliable transportation is a key factor in finding employment and accessing essential services. Unfortunately, for many in our homeless community, maintaining a bicycle can be a financial burden.

This past weekend, AAI hosted a special **Bike Repair Event** dedicated to helping our neighbors in need.

### Event Impact
Our team of skilled mechanics and enthusiastic volunteers worked tirelessly to:
- Repair **35** bicycles
- Replace **20** worn-out tires
- Install **15** new chains
- Provide **50** safety lights

Beyond the repairs, it was a day of connection and shared stories. We provided warm meals and coffee, creating a welcoming space for everyone.

### Moving Forward
We plan to make this a quarterly event! If you have spare bike parts or would like to volunteer your mechanical skills, please reach out to us.

Together, we can keep our community moving forward.
